hi prof robson!

just here to tell you that i roughly skimmed your guide and also know how to
     use github and am submitting this as proof of that fact.
     or something like that.
i also have used markdown before but this note doesn't seem to warrant that.
i also am not going to make a profile readme because i don't wanna
  make a repository with my github username right now?
  and it's not important to me yet.

hope you had fun byebye <3
